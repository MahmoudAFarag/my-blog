A few days ago, I sat down at night when I usually finish my work and try to discuss and organize my ideas, yes I'm a night owl. A thought came into my mind which occupied that whole night. A thought that made me look back at some of my plans and ideas and how they were processed.
When I analyzed the progress of these plans, I concluded that 80% of my actions and plans were shelved and yes 80% is not a typo. But why were they shelved? Is it because of procrastination?. No, it was because of fear. So, let us talk about fear.

When the word "fear" is uttered out, people programmatically assume that it is something bad. Something that hunts you down on every action and thought that pops into your head. It is even widely used as the standard answer for the "What is your worst concern in life" question. To be honest, I won't disagree that fear can be a bad thing and something that we always place on the unpleasant spectrum, but what we always miss is that fear can also be a good thing. To further explain my point let us first see how science defines fear:

" Fear is one of the most basic human emotions. It is programmed into the nervous system and works like an instinct. From the time we're infants, we are equipped with the survival instincts necessary to respond with fear when we sense danger or feel unsafe. When we sense danger, the brain reacts instantly, sending signals that activate the nervous system. This causes physical responses, such as a faster heartbeat, rapid breathing, and an increase in blood pressure. "

So wait, from my experience fear was a bad thing that prevented me from accomplishing most of my plans, but when we look at how science defined fear it looks like a natural response that helps us react to different situations. This split in meaning made me try to approach fear in a different way. If you are like me, I believe that every thing exists for a reason especially if it is something natural. 

After trying to find out why fear exists as a natural response, I concluded that it is a double-edged sword and the trick is to know how to control and utilize it in both directions instead of letting it control you in one direction. Fear can be the reason to push you away from something that would have caused harm to you or it can push you towards something dark and harmful. I remember someone once approached me and told me about how his workplace was toxic and how his boss was always abusing his powers on him. 

Here, fear can play 2 roles according to how this person utilizes it. On one hand, fear of confronting his boss can take over him and force him to stay quiet and work under pressure that can later do irreversible damage. On the other hand, he can direct the fear towards his well-being and use it as a force to fuel up the confrontation between him and his boss and end up this toxic part of his life. Spoiler: He was brave enough to be able to use it to end this toxic part.

But sadly, controlling fear is not an easy process and takes time to develop and it all comes down to how toxic people became with each other. At a younger age, I mostly encountered the bad side of fear. I either had a fear that I won't be able to commit to my ideas, or I had a fear of people's opinions and how they will criticize and underestimate my words. Even some of my friends who were supposed to encourage and protect me from these fears were actually that one that indirectly made me fear and suppress my ideas.

Comments like: "Just stop thinking and go to sleep", "These are just dreams, live like a normal person", "Why would you do that, are you okay?", "It is hard to do anything new, just drop it out" were the primary reason for the suppression of this 80% of my ideas. What makes it harder is when you charge up your courage to confront these people and think that this will end up this toxicity, you get a worse response: "It was a joke, don't be so serious!". They simply defend their actions under the umbrella of sarcasm. The result? you stay quiet and build up more tension and stress inside you.

I came to a point where I had to free up that built-up toxicity and stress. I studied the pattern of people's comments and actions and developed a mindset that can counter these toxic influences. Let me share some of them with you:

## 1. Care less about people's opinion

The key that made me break this cycle was to learn how to care less about people's opinions When I usually started a new idea I always spoke to people about it, take their comments, and then start working, and this turned out to be the issue for me. Most of the times taking people's opinion before starting my idea led that I became unmotivated and think that it had many flaws. Instead, I started working on my ideas quietly and then take people's opinions. This ensured that at least I have a finished starter project that I can later build on. Even when people unmotivate you, you still have a finished project which didn't end up being just an idea.

## 2. Know your worth

This is a really important one. we ALWAYS underestimate ourselves no matter how we are convinced that we know our potential. Think of how many times you were hesitant about doing something and then it turned out to be a great step forward. I even consider this as the main entry point for fear. Once someone starts doubting himself, fear starts spreading inside you and takes over your confidence. To overcome this, start by breaking your idea or task into steps. Why? because usually when we try to implement an idea as a whole we easily become overwhelmed to a degree where we don't find the starting point and end up abandoning the idea. Want to start a business? focus on organizing the core concept first, don't distract yourself with the location and the number of employees just yet. Secondly, if you think that something will work for about 40% then take the risk and do it because again since we naturally underestimate ourselves, once you start and work on it you will find that it is actually 70% and in a matter of time you will pump it up to 100%.

## 3. Be versatile (Have a Backup)

We usually fixate our mind on a single plan and try to implement it no matter what by rejecting any modification even if you know that it is needed. This mindset pulls us back several miles from progression. Always be open to modifications especially if it will enhance the idea. Suppose you prepared a campaign for a specific product and you planned on promoting it on a platform where it will be seen more, but your product will be less relevant for its audience. On the other hand, you found another platform with less audience but your product will have more impact on its audience. Usually, you will go for the first platform as you want to see numbers and more interaction but when you think about it, you will find that after days of announcing your product **1000** people saw it and only **100** purchased it. If you went for the second platform you will find that **250** people saw it but **150** purchased it. By being flexible and not focusing only on numbers you developed a successful campaign with more impact.

# The Verdict

These are just some of the tips that can hopefully help you control your fear. As much as fear made me suppress many of my thoughts, it later made me approach life differently. Remember that you are the judge of yourself and base your judgment on your past self, not on someone else. Go after your ideas and don't let the fear of judgment pull you back. You are capable of way more than you think and time will prove this to you. Always want the best for yourself and reject any change that will stress you out. Speak out about your fears instead of giving them a house inside of you. Direct your fear towards your well-being and make it the reason you get out of the comfort zone and unleash your potential. Thank you for making it till here as this was a long one and let me wish you a life with no stress and endless accomplishments!.
