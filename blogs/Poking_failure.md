Success is always desired by any human being. Feeling successful fills your spirit with energy and motivation to grind through the challenges of life, But if you think about the previous sentence, you will come to a conclusion that success was an outcome of an encounter with a challenge. In other words, without the presence of obstacles and challenges success will not exist. Why will you try and give all your energy to something obtained easily? As the saying goes: “The sweetest victory is the one that’s most difficult”.

Nevertheless, the feeling of failure is strong. It masks all the beauty from a person’s life. I always wonder when I stumble upon failure and feel defeated: “Am I weak? Am I the only person who exaggerates this feeling? Why does this feeling take over all my motivation?. The answer to these questions is No! It is completely normal to have this feeling. However, what is abnormal is to let this feeling take over your thinking and spirit. One strong solution is to develop a fearless mind, a mind that gets more motivated when it meets failure. Indeed the process takes time but trust me it is WORTH IT. Here are a few things that helped me develop such mind:

1. **Always** see the positive side in things. I know it sounds simple, but we always anticipate the worst of things which makes us in a mental loop of failure. Instead, step in with a mind knowing that the best is going to happen. Fear of failure simply strengthens failure.
2. **Know** that your potential is endless, as long as you are trying and pushing yourself towards success. Your experience and potential are growing!
3. **Surround** yourself with optimistic people. Being surrounded by negative or toxic people will just make the process harder and make you more prone to failure.
4. **Get out** of your comfort zone and try new things. You can stay on the safe side and never try anything new, or get out of your comfort zone and eat these failures to strengthen your mindset. “ One of the biggest secrets to success is operating inside your strength zone but outside of your comfort zone”.

Still not convinced that success derives from failure? Here are stories of successful people and their journey to fame:

# J.K Rowling

J.K Rowling was living a harsh life. She was divorced with a child and was living on
government aid which barely made her able to feed herself and her child. However,
three years after the divorce she challenged herself and started writing the greatest of all
time: Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone! Is that it? Did simply writing a book
defeat all the challenges?

Nope. She wrote the book and tried to convince many
publishers to accept her book and publish it but no one accepted it. She even made
manual copies of the book as she was not able to afford photocopying it until finally
someone accepted her book and made her rise to a place where she never expected.

# Colonel Sanders

After being fired from several jobs throughout his entire life, At the age of 40 he started
cooking chicken at a gas station as it had no restaurants. People quickly recognized the
unique taste of his chicken and started coming for more. Was it again that easy? Nope. It
took him 10 years to perfect his blend of special spices and the unique way of frying the
chicken in a pressure pan. End of story?

Nope. Once he mastered his recipe, Kentucky state made a reconstruction and rerouting for its streets which led to many main streets that took to his restaurant to be destroyed which eventually led to the fall of this business and to retire with 0 dollars in his pocket. Fighting through failure he started going around looking for people to let him serve his chicken and work for them. After numerous failures he finally found someone that believed in him and made him open the famous KFC restaurant that is present in almost all countries.

# Oprah Winfrey

Oprah Winfry started a hard life where she received a lot of criticism and bullying ranging
from her race to her gender. She was a victim of many crimes and abuse that resulted in
her becoming pregnant when she was only 14 years old. Even when she came over the
challenges and gave birth, her son died within 2 weeks. Pushing through all these
obstacles she finished high school as an honorable student, received a full scholarship
to college, and started applying to become a television representer. Now she owns a
COMPLETE network not just a show.

# The Verdict

I hope by now you are convinced that failure is just part of success. Without challenges
we will never have a reason to push our potential to the furthest. Always remember that
failing is a sign of trying. Sure people who play it safe are less likely to fail but what is the
worth of life and dreams if they are not turned into realities. Don’t let someone who is
sitting behind a screen without taking any risks criticize your efforts.

Remember, you
have a limitless potential while this person almost has no potential. We only live once so
we better make it worth the living, feed on rejections and rise to a place where criticism
can’t be heard. If you made it to this line I would like to thank you for taking a journey into
my mind and let me wish you a BIG and sincere happy life and I’m sure you will reach
beyond your dreams !
