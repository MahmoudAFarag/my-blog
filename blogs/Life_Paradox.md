# The Paradox of life

Torn between acting from a spontaneous perspective and acting according to knowledge and mind-readings. Is it just a reality or is it an equation to be cracked? When I split my thoughts about life into equations, I came to a conclusion that life can be split into 2 rather obvious equations: The Life equation and the Anti-life equation. Picking which equation to follow will determine all your actions.

The Anti-life equation can be formulated as follows:

Loneliness + Alienation + Fear + Despair + Self-Worth ÷ Mockery ÷ Condemnation ÷ Misunderstanding ⋅ Guilt ⋅ Shame ⋅ Failure ⋅ Judgment n=y where y=Hope and n=Folly, Love=Lies, Life=Death, Self=Dark Side.

The Anti-Life Equation has the power to dominate the will of any sentient race in addition to reality-altering powers that twist and distort freedom over life and death. "If someone possesses absolute control over you—you're not really alive."

By following the equation you can insert the full formula into your mind, giving yourself the mathematical certainty that life, hope, and freedom are all pointless.

On the other hand, The Life Equation is the complete opposite of the latter formula which is formulated as follows:

Companionship + Understanding + Assurance + Joy + Altruism ÷ Respect ÷ Commendation ÷ Sympathy ⋅ Innocence ⋅ Dignity ⋅ Success ⋅ Acceptance y=n where y=Despair and n=Caution, Love=Truth, Death=Rebirth, and Self=Light Side

The life equation has the power to breath life into any sentient race and can subjugate life to follow the user in the creation of a new world order in favor of protection of life rather than accepting the meaninglessness of it as with the Anti-Life Equation.

Looking at both equations we can come to a conclusion that we must work on gathering the ingredients that make up the Life-equation. However, if you thought about the process you will find that in order to gather the desired ingredients you should experience the opposite ingredients first. You will never know the true definition of respect unless you experience mockery, you will never know the true definition of love unless you experience hate.

Lets give meaning to our lives and work on getting out any individual who is stuck following the Anti-life formula by showing them respect and sympathy. Nothing is ever worthless and even if you stumble upon something worthless, work on giving it meaning. Be on the side of the Life equation explorers and wake up / stop the Anti-life equation explorers!
