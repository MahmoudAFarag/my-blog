## Who are you ?

Did you ever ask yourself: "What is the real purpose for my life?" or "Why do I have to exist?". Did you ever want to enter somebody else's mind just to see if it works differently? To be honest, I had all these questions at some point in my life and I would like to express some of the thoughts and mentality that I acquired throughout my journey.

I have always wondered about the origin of human behavior. Do I base my actions on the fact of goodwill or just to see the acceptance from the surrounding eyes? Even when no one is watching, do I do it for my own satisfaction and to convince myself that I am a good person, or do I do it to help others. Personally, I think we all carry demons and angels and an unconstant scale of good and bad.

Selfishness was put inside us from the beginning before even having a soul. We started by sucking the life of our mothers although we were also given the power to fight for ourselves. Remember, your thoughts do not define you, only your actions do. To put yourself to the test, I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself. What do you see? Do you see the real you or do you see the version you think people see or Do you see the version you want to be seen as?

Am I a good person if I just smile in someone's face when the only thought inside my mind is to punch him in the face and hurt him in every way possible? We became bad when we slipped down to the dark place of our soul and let ego and selfishness take over and when we stopped fighting our hardest battle which is inside of us and even when we win the battle and start acting good it turns out to be an illusion, a temporary win. We can't win against ourselves as it is not a single battle, we just have to keep fighting even if we can't afford it.

## The Ambiguity of Life

Another question that keeps popping inside my head is: What can't we just succeed in life's test and go straight to heaven leaving it down here as it is without bothering ourselves to lift a toe? Why does it have to be a test?. What answered these questions for me was the following great quote: "I refuse to live my life simply because I was born into it". We need to have a reason to live, we need to be seen and heard.

If you think about it, part of how we see ourselves is greatly influenced by how others see us. We need to surround ourselves with positive people who will make a good impact on how we see ourselves. At one time in my life, I thought that to solve this problem I had to block the outer influence overall and refuse any closure or company. But to be totally honest, we can't live alone. We need company. The fact that we can handle loneliness does not mean that we tolerate the process. Even the ones who live in the darkest places don't want to die alone.

For me, I was never afraid of death. I am just afraid of the void and emptiness I will leave behind. The responsibilities that only I can handle. So, the first question to ask yourself why are you alive? What makes you refuse to die? once you find the reason you will unlock a whole new perspective on the reason of existence. I've once read that God asked us before our souls landed on earth: "Do you want to be created as an angel or as a human? and then erased our memory.

If we in fact had the choice to either become impeccable angels but without having any ending reward or punishment or take the risk and become human beings with free will and the choice to either save or kill a life but there are consequences for our actions either by punishment or rewards. If you chose to live this life, then u should struggle and keep moving forward. You have to fight and earn it instead of sitting down feeling insecure and sorry for yourself.

So, why can't we take out our life even if we chose to live it? Simply because taking your life doesn't hurt you it only hurts others. Parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and even the old lady you helped to cross the street thinks you deserve to live. Once you came here, your life is not yours. Our lives are like a spider net, you can't cut a corner and expect everything to be fine. So, get stronger and think again and again until you make it through the hardships.

Depression is like glue. Even when you think u removed it, some is still left on you and even the part you removed took some of your skin with it. So after all these explanations, the first question on your mind is: What should you do? Don't expect an answer for that question as every one has a tool inside to fight. Maybe we just fight the effect of depression, not the depression itself, maybe we just tell ourselves that we are good to be able to function again, but I know that one morning you will wake up and find everything okay and that depression is lifted so just keep going until u find your salvation.

No hatred carried you, move till ur body can no more, you do what you have to do, you deny every bad thing that happens. You Fight till you can no more. You Forgive as long as you can unless they hate anime and movies <3.
