After 9 months, 40 weeks, and 274 days, you are introduced to the beautiful, endless world of oceans bumbling over white rocks, and people rushing to their goals and dreams. You start by experiencing the bright side of the world where stress and thinking don’t exist. A side where your goal is to have fun and seek your happiness from the slightest gestures and visuals presented to you.

From my modest 21 years of life experience, I found out how precious and easy the first days of life were. Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying that life later will be worse or harder, it’s just going to be filled with more challenges and responsibilities. The question now is: “Is it too late now if I missed these supreme days?”. The
short answer is NO.

It’s never too late to experience the bright side of your life, surely these early days are an advantage to have, but missing this advantage isn’t going to drastically affect how you can still change your life to be better. A conflict I personally experienced ,and to be honest still experiencing, is my passion. I was fortunate enough to fall in love with what I knew is truly my passion aka my journey to success and happiness. However, reaching the age of 18 I started experiencing the challenges that appear as I mentioned. My mind started diverting from its primary thoughts to the sound of the “motivational” and “caring” family. The thought that becoming anything outside the medical field is a direct insult to the family.

At first, I was like: “it’s not that bad and after all being a doctor is an honor to you and people will praise you non-stop”. However, later that same year the seduction of my true dream kicked in. A seduction that cannot be explained in words, a bright light welcoming your into its arms where you will find extreme comfort! I started thinking about the future and how my life should be shaped and took the decision of working on both responsibilities parallel to each other. This plan worked for about a year but during this year I deep dived into both fields and man oh man! How good my true passion felt at that moment.

However, I went into a dangerous phase where you start thinking without organizing and this leads to a HUGE mess inside your mind. You will end up failing at all your unorganized thoughts and this can progress into depression. I reckon that you are currently raising the question: "Where is the bright side that you promised? Did I really miss my only opportunity of happiness and comfort?". It’s there, the bright side is always there and all you have to do is just take a small break and start organizing your messy thoughts. For me, although I didn’t really like the medical field, I was blessed by meeting wonderful supportive friends who made me forget about all the regrets I had, friends who made me rethink about the meaning of happiness.

It’s not all about your passion and the typical “running to live” style of life, you should always believe that you are placed into a path for a reason that may not appear early but trust me it will appear and shine at some point. Taking this
approach, I started working again towards both responsibilities without making the powerful seduction of the passion take over my life. I started appreciating all the things around me ranging from the fact that I woke up and had the chance to
start a new day, all the way to all the people around me that make my life more enjoyable.

Speaking about the reason for each path, who knows if I didn’t experience this challenge I would be more mature as of now and more determined and organized towards my future? The strong irony that the beauty in my life that changed me was in fact the challenge that we all fear!

It’s always nice to have a passion and seek this passion as early as possible. However, it’s never too late if you discover your passion at a later stage. ALWAYS remember that there is a reason for every part of your life. Don’t let one
thought or goal determine the shape of your life. Always diversify your thoughts and goals into many pieces that will be linked to a happy, healthy life. You are loved, blessed and strong enough to turn any challenge to a meaningful lesson.
Live life to the fullest, break any thoughts that hold you back, and seek a life you are proud to write about.
