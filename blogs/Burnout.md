How am I feeling? Thanks for asking! To be honest, I'm having a rather weird feeling. I feel tired and exhausted but not physically, I'm tired mentally. Each time I try to come up with an idea or even execute an existing idea, I procrastinate and feel like not wanting to do it. I even reached a point where I'm not motivated to do the thing I used to dedicate my entire day to and at this point I had to stop and analyze the reason for this feeling. Is it simply exhaustion? is it desensitization? Is it temporary or is it permenant?.

When I tried to find out the origin of this feeling, I found that the most suitable explanation for my state is one word: Burnout. It is the feeling of being drained. You don't have the power to do anything anymore and by our innate behaviour we keep on ignoring this feeling without acting on ending it. I wasn't fortunate enough to read about this feeling early enough. I found out that putting too much effort into something will lead to decreased attention and even worse results.

I've always wanted to have plenty of time in my possession, and when the whole world went into lockdown I invested my whole day into learning and pursuing the career that I've always wanted. Let me tell you right now, it was an amazing feeling! I did not have any college assignments nor did I have any work due that I didn't like doing. Just a plain simple cycle that skyrockets my adrenaline: sleep, watch, work, learn, and of course what I mean by learning is watching courses about a subject that I liked.

I stayed on this cycle for about 2 months until I hit a point that I didn't know how to explain at that moment. To clearly show the point I've reached, let's demonstrate the point by slightly modifying my cycle: sleep, watch, sleep, watch. See what happened? The working and learning parts of the cycle just simply disappeared. I found myself lazy to stand up and go do some work and even worse I didn't have any motive to know the origin of the exhaustion.

When I found out that I wasn't motivated to do the things I usually do, guess what did I do? I forced myself into doing them and that is where the big problem lies in the matter of burnout. We think that by battling burnout we will end the feeling or forcing ourselves into a certain cycle will help us accommodate the phase. However, that opposite is true, once you find yourself burned out or having no motives to do your routine the first thing to do is stop the things you normally do and take a break of a minimum of 7 days.

But what about the feeling of FOMO or fear of missing out? You feel that by taking a break you will miss a lot of things happening around you. But, trust me on this if you sacrifice 7 days of forced work you will come back stronger and will pick up all the things you missed in a few hours or days. Ok, now we found out that by taking a break we can get out the feeling of burnout and get back on track stronger. However, is burnout a feeling you get from working or learning only? or is there more to it?

Burnout can happen in plenty of other situations such as burning out emotionally. We all try to show our best to people once we meet them and then try to maintain our best throughout our path with them. But, this spark of the excitement of showing our best to people can quickly die if there is no response to it. Not all people will appreciate or give back the same qualities and good deeds you gave them. You will find yourself giving a lot more than receiving and therefore you will start burning out slowly. You will start to care less about people and that is not the real dilemma.

The real dilemma is building up a permanently modified version of yourself. A version that starts to care less about people altogether even if they are giving you the same goodwill and sharing the same feelings and that is the dark side of burnout. It can leave permanent damage on the individual. Therefore my advice is to take a break and return to your normal self. In some situations, changing can be actually a good thing that keeps you out of harm and healthier but overall the solution in most cases is just taking a break as there is a good and a bad side to everything and eventually you will cross paths with the right people.

There are more examples of how you can get burned out but, I've looked up for the most encoutered types and summarized them as follows:

## 1. The Overachiever

This person is described as someone with no realistic goals and wants everything at an abnormal rate. This person focuses on getting the end goal without enjoying the process of getting there which causes this person to be stressed constantly. Don't become overwhelmed easily and try to overachieve things. Enjoy the journey and the process even if it will take time. Focus on quality and not quantity. One big clear goal is way better than 5 unrealistic goals.

## 2. The Perfectionist

This person believes that anything less that perfect is a failure. This person never embraces his/her mistake. Instead, they work with a mindset that they cannot do any mistake. This person has trouble completing projects because they always think there’s a way to make it better and they have an all or nothing mentality, meaning they think you’re either successful or not—no gray area. Try to aim for initial results and then improve on them. Get your idea to the world with 80% and then work on making it a 100%.

## 3. The Micromanager

This person struggles to trust anyone else to get things done. Because of this, they take on the job alone, believing that if you want it done right you have to do it yourself and in my opinion, this is one of the fastest routes to burnout as you will drain yourself excessively while you were able to divide the work between you and your colleagues. Share your skills and knowledge with others instead of keeping it for yourself and the world will see your achievements faster.

## 4. The People Pleaser

This person is obsessed with, well, pleasing other people, going so far as to believe that saying yes to every little ask will avoid disappointing or hurting the people around them. This leads to difficulties in setting boundaries, overwhelming fear of making someone mad and doing what everyone else wants even if it doesn’t suit their best interests. Never mix your feelings with the right thing to do. A no that can disappoint one person can save 100 others.

# The Verdict

Burnout is a serious matter that cannot be ignored as it can cause permanent changes in the individual. My advice is to dissect and take your goals step by step and in case of people-pleasing, do not give too much to people as it can drain you fast. Always help and show love to people but never at the cost of your well-being. Take constant breaks through your journey and remember to enjoy the process itself and the result will come at your doorstep. As I always say, we are capable of much more than we think. Never stop dreaming and working towards your goal but remember to set realistic goals and periods. I'm confident that every single one of us will reach our goal. So, see you at your dream goal champion!
